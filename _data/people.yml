# in addition to information enumerated here, a person may _optionally_ choose to 
# create expanded information in _people/<id>.md
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# People are ordered on the People page as follows:
#   in the order they are found in this file
# However, we recommend using the order (but it is not enforced by the code):
#   PI first, then active members, than inactive members (i.e., those with an end_date)
#   within the active group, by start_date (oldest members first)
#   within the inactive group, by end_date (most recently departed members first)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the 'id' field is the unique identifier used for tagging and md files
# '_' characters are removed from the 'id' field to create the name used in Badges

  description: I am an incoming (Fall 2024) assistant professor at the department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada. In August of 2023, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Biological Engineering at the department of Biological Systems Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA. After graduation, I had one-year of Postdoctoral research experience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the RIPE project (link to RIPE). 
My research expertise spans multiple disciplines, including agricultural engineering, data science, and plant science. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained rich research experience in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), ground and proximal plant phenotyping tools, multi-modal data (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and LiDAR) processing, data-driven machine learning and deep learning models, as well as physics-driven radiative transfer models.
Moving forward, my research endeavors will center on digital technologies for agri-food systems, with a keen focus on proximal and remote sensing, robotics and automation systems, internet-of-things (IoTs), and physics-guided AI.
