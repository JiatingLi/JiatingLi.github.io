## Mission 
### To elevate agricultural productivity and sustainability through cutting-edge digital technologies and advanced analytical methodologies.

<br>
We employ a wide range of tools to monitor crop growth and development, including *remote sensing* technologies (UAVs and satellites), *optical sensors*, ground-based *robotics*, and Internet-of-Things (*IoT*) devices. Leveraging data-driven *Artificial Intelligence* (machine and deep learning models) and physics-driven *process-based models* (radiative transfer model, crop growth model), we make accurate and robust predictions for crop performance.

## Join us!
I am actively looking for graduate students to join our lab at the [Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/engineering/biosystems). Students with strong self-motivation and passion for agricultural engineering are welcome to contact me.
