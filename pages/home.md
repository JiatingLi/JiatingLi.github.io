### Mission 
**To elevate agricultural productivity and sustainability through cutting-edge digital technologies and advanced analytical methodologies.**

<br>
We employ a wide range of tools to monitor crop growth and development, including remote sensing technologies (UAVs and satellites), optical sensors, ground-based robotics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. By harnessing the power of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (machine and deep learning models) and physics-driven process-based models (radiative transfer model, crop growth model), we deliver accurate and robust predictions on crop performance.

### Join us!
I am looking for one Master and one PhD student to join our lab at the [Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/engineering/biosystems). The anticipated start date is January or May 2025. Students with strong self-motivation and passion for agricultural engineering are encouraged to apply.
