I am an incoming (Fall 2024) assistant professor at the department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada. In August of 2023, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Biological Engineering at the department of Biological Systems Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA. After graduation, I had one-year of Postdoctoral research experience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the RIPE project.
<br>

My research expertise spans multiple disciplines, including agricultural engineering, data science, and plant science. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained rich research experience in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), ground and proximal plant phenotyping tools, multi-modal data (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and LiDAR) processing, data-driven machine learning and deep learning models, as well as physics-driven radiative transfer models.
<br>

Moving forward, my research endeavors will center on digital technologies for agri-food systems, with a keen focus on proximal and remote sensing, robotics and automation systems, internet-of-things (IoTs), and physics-guided AI.
