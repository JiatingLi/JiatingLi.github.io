I am an undergraduate student studying in the Faculty of Biosystems Engineering at the University of Manitoba. I previously studied in the Faculty of Biology with a specialization in Environment and Ecology before transferring to Engineering. 
I am interested in the intersection of health, technology and the environment and am passionate about the applications of agricultural research.
