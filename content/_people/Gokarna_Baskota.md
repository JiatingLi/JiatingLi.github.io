For my master’s research, I am majorly focusing on the development of a robotics system for capturing winter wheat leaf conditions along with the weather conditions. Our goal is to capture the leaf images even if they are bent or covered using a modular vision sensor integrated with the robot. We will use these images and supporting data for detailed analysis of any symptoms present on the crop with the help of machine learning techniques.

Being a graduate research assistant under the AIDE lab, I have been also selected for the RBC scholarship for sustainable agriculture. You can visit [here](https://news.umanitoba.ca/2025-rbc-scholars-explore-sustainable-agriculture/) for more information.
