I am an undergraduate student of the Department of Biosystems Engineering at the University of Manitoba. For the summer, I am a student researcher under the supervision of Dr. Li. My main project includes the prediction of canola yields while I am also taking part in other projects like detecting winter wheat leaf disease and microwave and multispectral synergistic sensing.
