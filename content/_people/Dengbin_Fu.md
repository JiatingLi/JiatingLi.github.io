I am a Ph.D. student at South China Agricultural University and a visiting student at the University of Manitoba, I am engaged in research on visual navigation for rice field management robots. My work primarily involves the fields of deep learning, image processing, and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technologies.
