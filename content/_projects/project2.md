title: Unsupervised pre-training enhances deep learning model for crop stress detection 
subtitle: Conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
description: Our proposed unsupervised pre-training strategy mitigated the requirement of intensive training data for deep learning models. Leveraging unlabeled UAV-collected RGB images, this approach significantly enhanced performance in rating the severity of soybean iron deficiency chlorosis, surpassing models without pre-training.
