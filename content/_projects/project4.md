title: High-throughput plant phenotyping 
subtitle: Conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
description: Plant phenotypes are the observable traits of a plant, like height and leaf size. High-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) is a burgeoning technology facilitating rapid and efficient quantification of these traits. In our research, we developed and optimized UAV-based HTPP pipelines to extract common plant phenotypes. These extracted phenotypes were further used to predict more complex plant traits like biomass and grain yield. Our findings demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of UAV-based HTPP for large-scale crop breeding field trials.
