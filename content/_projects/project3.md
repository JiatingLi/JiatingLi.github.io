title: Multimodal data fusion for drought tolerance assessment 
subtitle: Conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
description: We employed UAV-based multimodal images, including RGB, multispectral, and thermal data, to evaluate the drought tolerance of bioenergy sorghum. By leveraging the concept of drought tolerance index, we directly ranked hundreds of sorghum genotypes based on UAV-estimated biomass. Our work highlights the significant potential of UAV remote sensing technology for in-field selection of drought tolerant genotypes.
