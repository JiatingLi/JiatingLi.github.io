title: Plant 3D reconstruction  
subtitle: Conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2023 - 2024)
description: Data pipelines were created to extract multiple crop structural features, such as plant height and leaf area index, from three-dimensional (3D) LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors. LiDAR emits laser pulses that can effectively penetrate crop canopies, providing comprehensive plant structural information. It is an excellent complement to UAV-based remote sensing.
